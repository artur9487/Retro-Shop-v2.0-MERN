# Current development

It is a e-commerce React.js app. The app is based on the authentication flow. Every user can add a retro product which will be displayed with other products in the display board. The user can check different analytics about the purchases, comments and ratings of his products. The user can also check his history of all his purchases and transactions. The app has a cart menu in which the user can add or remove different products. In the menu, the user receives notifications about the actions like comments and purchases of his product. The various data fragments are transferred to Firebase Cloud Database and received through redux saga middleware (For better insight purposes, I made the possibility to buy and comment own products).

# Planned development

It is planned to integrate the app with stripe. It will also be possible to search the products through the character pattern. The user will be able to filter the products according to the distance radius.
